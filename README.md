# Overview 

This game is a passion project with most assets made by myself. I used Unity 6 with C# to power the project. 

## Compatability

* No controller support (yet)
* No mobile support (yet)
* Windows required
* Keyboard and mouse/trackpad required 

## Performance

This game sould run very well on any system that supports Directx 12. My system (RTX 4060ti, i5 13600kf, and 32gb of ddr5 ram 6000mhz) runs the game at around 820 fps.
